# This extension is discontinued and not maitained

Sorry about that. I had to pull it down from Adobe Exchange due to installation bug that some users faced.
At the same time I couldn't refund those users because Adobe doesn't deliver any refund tool.
That didn't feel fair. (And I wasn't making a fortune on it anyways, lol)
If you need to edit 360 video I think [GoPro FX Reframe](https://community.gopro.com/t5/en/GoPro-FX-Reframe/ta-p/412890) is currently the best way.

# Reframe Controls Video Effect

This is only for troubleshooting purposes.

The effect should install just fine from Adobe Exchange, but if it didn't:

1) Click `VRReframeControlsWinPR.aex` above and choose `Download`
2) You might get a warning from chrome that `.aex` is not commonly downloaded blah blah... choose ignore
3) Put the downloaded file in `C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Premiere Pro CC 2019\Plug-Ins\Common\ReframeControls` 
or wherever your installation of Premiere is. If `ReframeControls` folder is not there just create it.
4) Restart Premiere, look for plugin in `Effects` panel by typing `Reframe`

Alternatively, check [Install another way](https://exchange.adobe.com/creativecloud/install-instructions.103165.html) 
section that is shown after purchasing the plugin.
